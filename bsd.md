# Blind Spot Detection with side-rectilinear images
The blind-spot detection (BSD) system is designed to prevent accidents during lane changing and overtaking scenarios.
Current BSD systems that use side- or rear-view cameras suffer from limited performance because of the severe distortion in the appearance of nearby vehicles depending on their positions relative to the host vehicle.
To overcome such limitations, this project introduces a side-rectilinear image to detect and use the side parts of the vehicles.
In the side-rectilinear image, the side parts of the vehicles do not contain radial or perspective distortions; consequently, the appearance of the tires remains identical from different positions on the vehicle.
